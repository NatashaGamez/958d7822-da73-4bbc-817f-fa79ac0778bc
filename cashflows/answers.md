### What does it means when the internal-rate of return is greater than the hurdle rate?
The hurdle rate is the minimum rate that the investor expects to earn when investing in a project.
The IRR , is the interest rate at which the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows, both positive and negative, from a project is equal to zero.
So if the IRR is greater or higher than the hurdle rate in means that the project has good chances of being approve.

### Can the net present value be negative? Why?
Yes, it can happen. Because maybe the project or the company evaluted doesn't make enough to cover all expenses made today.
